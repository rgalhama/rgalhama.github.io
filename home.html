  Hello, world!

  <br />
  I am Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="http://www.mpi.nl/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics</a>. My research focuses on computational modelling of language learning, on topics that range from auditory and visual statistical learning to structure learning, sentence processing and language development. I am currently working with Caroline Rowland and Evan Kidd on modelling individual differences in word learning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously, I worked at the <a href="http://www.bcbl.eu/?lang=en" target="_blank">Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language</a>. Together with Ram Frost and Blair Armstrong, we investigated the effects of entropy on visual word recognition. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
I did my PhD at the <a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Institute of Logic, Language and Computation</a>, at the University of Amsterdam, where I worked with Jelle Zuidema, Carel Ten Cate and Remko Scha on Computational Modelling of Artificial Language Learning.

  <!--Before, I completed a master's degree in <a href="http://www.ub.edu/ccil/?q=en/content/introduction">Cognitive Science and Language</a>, and even before that, I became a Superior Engineer in Informatics (which is fancy for "Computer Scientist").-->
