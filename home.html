  I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://csai.nl/" target="_blank">Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence</a> department, at <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/" target="_blank">Tilburg University</a>.  My research focuses on computational modelling of language learning, on topics that range from auditory and visual statistical learning to structure learning, sentence processing and language development. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="http://www.mpi.nl/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics</a>. I worked with Evan Kidd and Caroline Rowland on computational modelling of word learning. Previously, I worked at the <a href="http://www.bcbl.eu/?lang=en" target="_blank">Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language</a>, investigating the effects of entropy on visual word recognition with Blair Armstrong and Ram Frost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I did my PhD at the <a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Institute of Logic, Language and Computation</a>, at the <a href="http://www.uva.nl/" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam</a>. My thesis, supervised by Jelle Zuidema, Remko Scha and Carel Ten Cate, focused on Computational Modelling of Artificial Language Learning.
