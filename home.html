  Hello, World!

  <br />
  I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.bcbl.eu/?lang=en">BCBL</a> since October 2017. I work with Ram Frost and Blair Armstrong on Computational Models of Visual Word Recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously, I was a PhD Candidate at the <a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Institute of Logic, Language and Computation</a>, at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, where I worked with Jelle Zuidema, Carel Ten Cate and Remko Scha on Computational Modelling of Artificial Language Learning.
  <br />
  <br />
  <!--Before, I completed a master's degree in <a href="http://www.ub.edu/ccil/?q=en/content/introduction">Cognitive Science and Language</a>, and even before that, I became a Superior Engineer in Informatics (which is fancy for "Computer Scientist").-->

  <h3>NEWS:</h3>
  Our paper was accepted for the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (special track on Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation, and Reasoning)!
